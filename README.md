# Predicting_Mortality_of_Heart_Failure_Patients

**📌 Project Overview**

This project aims to predict the mortality of heart failure patients using Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing clinical features such as age, blood pressure, serum creatinine, and other health indicators, the model helps identify high-risk patients and support healthcare decision-making.

The dataset used is based on real clinical records of heart failure patients. The primary objective is to build, evaluate, and compare machine learning models that predict whether a patient will survive or not.
